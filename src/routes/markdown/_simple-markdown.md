# Welcome to Markdown Rendering

This is a sample markdown file rendered using mdsvex.

## Features

Here are some features you can use in markdown:

- Lists with bullet points
- **Bold text** and _italic text_
- Links to [external sites](https://example.com)
- Code blocks

### Code Example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("mdsvex"));
```

### Another Section

You can have multiple levels of headings and organize your content with paragraphs. This demonstrates how mdsvex processes markdown files into Svelte components.

> This is a blockquote. You can use it to highlight important information.

#### Nested Heading

Lists can also be nested:

1. First item
2. Second item
   - Sub-item
   - Another sub-item
3. Third item

That's all for this sample!
